Instructions to update Octave code:

1. The extension of each Octave file must be ".m". Ensure that the function
   definitions are properly terminated with an "end" statement. When using
   Matlab, this isn't necessary.

2. Copy the .m files to the directory of the program.

3. Launch the program with "run".

4. If there are any problems, enter the commands in octcmds.txt or
   deploy/octcmds.txt to the interpreter manually after running the program.
   This file contains commands mixed with standard input, so you must not
   start Octave using the following command:

     octave octcmds.txt

   Use the following command instead:

     octave < octcmds.txt

   Octave should report details of the error.

   If you use Matlab instead of Octave and are having problems, you must
   create a text file named matlab_debug.txt to the program directory. The
   contents of this file don't matter. This causes the program to keep a log
   of the communication with Matlab. The log slows down the interface, so you
   should remove the file matlab_debug.txt after you have resolved all the
   problems. The log file is named matcmds.txt.
