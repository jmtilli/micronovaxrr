A lower bound for instrument resolution is determined by monochromator. If the
spectral line width is dlambda, the corresponding angular spread will be:

	kz = 2*pi*sin(theta)/lambda
	lambda*kz = 2*pi*sin(theta)
	kz dlambda/dtheta = 2*pi*cos(theta)
	dtheta = kz/(2*pi*cos(theta)) dlambda

where kz is the component of wave vector perpendicular to the monochromator.

	kz = 2*pi*sin(theta)/lambda

	dtheta = 2*pi*sin(theta) / (2*pi*cos(theta)) dlambda/lambda
		   = tan(theta) dlambda/lambda

However, the dtheta here is not the actual resolution, since x-ray
reflectivity is determined not by angle, but by z-component of wave vector
that is perpendicular to the sample (kz'). This program assumes that
wavelength is constant, which is strictly not true, so we define the
_apparent_ resolution as dalpha.

The perpendicular wave vector kz' is:

	kz' = 2*pi*sin(alpha + dtheta) / (lambda + dlambda)

and when assuming lambda is constant and dalpha the apparent resolution:

	kz' = 2*pi*sin(alpha + dalpha) / (lambda)

combining these two equations gives:

	sin(alpha + dtheta) / (lambda + dlambda) = sin(alpha + dalpha) / lambda

	sin(alpha + dtheta) / (1 + dlambda/lambda) = sin(alpha + dalpha)

	(sin(alpha)cos(dtheta) + cos(alpha)sin(dtheta)) / (1 + dlambda/lambda) = sin(alpha)cos(dalpha) + cos(alpha)sin(dalpha)

assuming dalpha and dtheta are small:

	(sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)dtheta) / (1 + dlambda/lambda) = sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)dalpha

	dalpha = (sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)dtheta - sin(alpha) - sin(alpha)*dlambda/lambda) / (1 + dlambda/lambda)
		   = (cos(alpha)dtheta - sin(alpha)*dlambda/lambda) / (1 + dlambda/lambda)

substituting dtheta = tan(theta) dlambda/lambda gives:

	dalpha = (cos(alpha) tan(theta) dlambda/lambda - sin(alpha)*dlambda/lambda) / (1 + dlambda/lambda)
		   = dlambda/lambda (cos(alpha) tan(theta) - sin(alpha)) / (1 + dlambda/lambda)

assuming dlambda/lambda is small compared to 1:

	dalpha = dlambda/lambda (cos(alpha)tan(theta) - sin(alpha))

In order to calculate apparent angular resolution, we need to know tan(theta).
Theta is determined by the monochromator.




For example, for Ge(111) monochromator with lattice constant[1] d = 0.564613 nm,
theta can be calculated from Bragg's law:

	2*d*sin(theta)/sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = lambda

	sin(theta) = lambda/d * sqrt(3)/2
			   = 0.154056 nm / 0.564613 nm * sqrt(3)/2
			   = 0.23630
		 theta = 0.23855 = 13.7°

for alpha = 0°, the apparent angular resolution is:

	dalpha = dlambda/lambda * tan(theta)
           = dlambda/lambda * 0.24318
           = dlambda/lambda * 13.9°

for alpha = 3°, the apparent resolution is:

	dalpha = dlambda/lambda * (cos(alpha) tan(theta) - sin(alpha))
           = dlambda/lambda * 0.19051
           = dlambda/lambda * 10.9°

The apparent angular resolution is nearly constant for small angles.

The average angular resolution between alpha = 0° and alpha = 3° is:
	dalpha = dlambda/lambda * 12.4°






For Cu K_alpha1 radiation, dlambda = 0.44e-4 nm [2]
and lambda = 0.154056 nm.

dalpha = 0.44e-4 nm / 0.154056 nm * 12.4°
dalpha = 0.00354° =~ 0.004°

This is the FWHM value of a Lorentzian distribution. This program uses a
Gaussian instead, which is a good approximation.


If K_alpha2 is not filtered out, the difference of wavelengths of K_alpha2 and
K_alpha1 is

	dlambda = 0.1544410 nm - 0.1540596 nm = 0.3814e-3 nm

and the corresponding apparent angular difference:

	dalpha = 0.3814e-3 nm / 0.154056 nm * 12.4° = 0.0307° =~ 0.031°

In this case, a Gaussian is not a good approximation, since there are two
spectral lines.
