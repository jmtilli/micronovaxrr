Example files of the following supported formats are missing:
- Bruker RAS
- Bruker RAW 2
- BRML (Bruker markup language)

Here are some sample Bruker RAW 2 files:
http://www.mx.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/QARR/raw/cpd-1a.raw
http://www.mx.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/QARR/raw/cpd-1b.raw
http://www.mx.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/QARR/raw/cpd-1c.raw
http://www.mx.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/QARR/raw/cpd-2.raw
http://www.mx.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/QARR/raw/cpd-3.raw

Here is sample Bruker RAS file:
https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/blob/master/data/PoleFigure/Bruker_xrd_10-10.ras
...except it contains multiple scans, so you need to edit with a text editor to
contain only one scan.

Here are some BRML files:
https://github.com/aboulle/DxTools/tree/master/Examples
Especially interesting is the Temperature.brml file. They seem to contain more
than one scan per file, but this software doesn't care and imports the first
scan.
